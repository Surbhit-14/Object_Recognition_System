# Real-Time Object Detection using TensorFlow.js and COCO-SSD

This project demonstrates real-time object detection using a webcam, powered by TensorFlow.js and the COCO-SSD (Common Objects in Context - Single Shot MultiBox Detector) pretrained model. It allows users to see live predictions of objects in the camera feed directly through their web browser.
## Duration : 5 hours

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Adds basic styling to the webpage elements.
- **JavaScript (TensorFlow.js)**: Integrates the COCO-SSD model and manages the webcam feed.
- **TensorFlow.js (COCO-SSD)**: Pretrained model for object detection.

## Installation

No installation is required other than a modern web browser with webcam support.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser that supports WebGL and WebRTC (e.g., Google Chrome).
3. Allow access to your webcam when prompted.
4. The webcam feed will start, and objects detected by COCO-SSD will be outlined in real-time.

## Real-Life Implementation

This project can be implemented in various real-life scenarios:

- **Security**: Monitoring for specific objects or intrusions.
- **Retail**: Tracking customer movements or inventory management.
- **Education**: Interactive demonstrations of object recognition.
